commandPattern
==============

Simple C++ implementation of the Command Pattern (GoF). Using a stl map to provide access to the commands via string identification.
Additionally this deals as an example for me to learn about git + github in combination with travis ci and qmake.

It's based on this tutorial: http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/38412-the-command-pattern-c/

It's kind of an easy extenable template for the usage of the command pattern. Feel free to use or mod it!
